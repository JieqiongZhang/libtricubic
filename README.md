# libtricubic

This repository contains a mirror of the version 1.0 of the _libtricubic_
library, developed by François Lekien in 2004.

The following paper explaining the method was published in 2005:

> Lekien, F., & Marsden, J. (2005). _Tricubic interpolation in three
> dimensions._ International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering,
> 63(3), 455–471. doi:10.1002/nme.1296

Some additional notes and the full matrix can be found in the technical notes:

> Lekien, F., Coulliette, C., & Marsden, J. (2004). _Tricubic Engine - Technical
> Notes and Full Matrix.

The main article refers to the author's website
(http://gyre.cds.caltech.edu/pub/software/tricubic/) to download the code and
documentation. Unfortunately, this website no longer exists. Even the
archive.org snapshot is useless; [A single snapshot from December 3rd 2009 is
available](https://web.archive.org/web/20091203115835/http://gyre.cds.caltech.edu/pub/software/tricubic)
which seems like an FTP listing. No files are accessible.

The listing shows:

The only place where the code could be found was on the `fix-phonon` project
[Google code page](https://code.google.com/p/fix-phonon/). The author has
[archived the tarball](https://code.google.com/p/fix-phonon/downloads/detail?name=tricubic-1.0.tgz&can=2&q=).
This tarball is extracted and archived in this repo too.
